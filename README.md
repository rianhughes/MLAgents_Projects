This repository is for my personal ML-Agents projects, and also acts as a testbed for work I am doing with OxAI (see 'vrai' repo).

## Navigation Agents

In this project I created an environment in Unity to teach an agent to navigate simple maze via imitation learning (Behavioural Cloning and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning), and also tested how well it generalises by placing it in a more complicated environment, that it had never seen before. Further, I find that agents with raycasts and visual information (camera) perform better than those with just visual information alone, keeping all other variables fixed.
